Commands

A command in screen can either be bound to a key, invoked from a screenrc file, or called from the colon prompt (see section Customizing Screen). As of version 3.3, all commands can be bound to keys, although some may be less useful than others. For a number of real life working examples of the most important commands see the files `etc/screenrc' and `etc/etcscreenrc' of your screen distribution.

In this manual, a command definition looks like this:

-- Command: command [-n] ARG1 [ARG2] ...
(keybindings)
This command does something, but I can't remember what.
An argument in square brackets (`[]') is optional. Many commands take an argument of `on' or `off', which is indicated as state in the definition.

Default Key Bindings: screen keyboard commands.
Command Summary: List of all commands.
Default Key Bindings

As mentioned previously, each keyboard command consists of a C-a followed by one other character. For your convenience, all commands that are bound to lower-case letters are also bound to their control character counterparts (with the exception of C-a a; see below). Thus, both C-a c and C-a C-c can be used to create a window.
